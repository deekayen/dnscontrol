Manage the [discoveryd](http://www.manpagez.com/man/8/discoveryd/) process Mac OS X 10.10 using [discoveryutil](http://www.manpagez.com/man/8/discoveryutil/).

Restart the mDNSResponder in other versions of macOS.

## Usage

Flushing the DNS cache requires administrator privileges. No arguments to the keyword will prompt you for a user and password.

For convenience, you can also enter your password after the keyword (separated by a space). The workflow does not store or submit password data. If the password is incorrect, you will be prompted anyway.

Success or failure is reported through a notification.

### Keyword: `dns flush`

Flushing DNS is the only keyword that works for OS X 10.7+. It will flush entries for both multicast and unicast DNS.
